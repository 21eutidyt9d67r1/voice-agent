# Customer Support with Handoff

## Conclusion

`agent.json` is a Voice Agent for a fictional AI platform's support line that
troubleshoots issues, answers verified account questions, and escalates to a
support ticket as a staged handoff graph.

By default its business tools run on the shared **mock-tool-call** MCP server:
Zendesk help-center search for troubleshooting steps, Salesforce contact lookup
to verify an account, and Zendesk tools to comment on an existing ticket or
open a new one. The mocks take the same arguments and return the same fields as
the real tools, but results are fictional and nothing real is filed. To connect
real systems, see [Connect real tools](../../docs/05_connect_real_tools.md).

No payment system is connected, so no refund, charge, or plan change happens on
the call.

## When to use this example

Use it to try triage between technical and account paths, article-grounded
troubleshooting, an identity check before account details, and an escalation
that waits for a yes, before you connect real help-center, CRM, or ticketing
tools.

## Workflow

| Stage | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `identify_issue` | Listen to the issue, capture the caller's name, and route to the technical or account path. |
| `troubleshoot` | Search the help center, then suggest one step at a time and wait for the result. |
| `account_billing` | Look the contact up by email, check the caller's full name against the record, then answer only from returned fields. |
| `resolve_or_escalate` | Confirm a fix, or read the escalation back and, after a yes, comment on the caller's ticket or open a new one. |
| `end` | Say a short goodbye and call `end_conversation`. |

Every stage can route to `end` as soon as the caller says goodbye or asks to
stop. Handoffs are silent: no edge carries a `transfer_message`.

Each stage carries the full persona, tone, and conversation rules because a
handoff node's instructions replace the session instructions.

### Mock tools by stage

| Stage | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| `troubleshoot` | `mock_tool_call_zendesk_search` |
| `account_billing` | `mock_tool_call_salesforce_search`, `mock_tool_call_salesforce_get_contact` |
| `resolve_or_escalate` | `mock_tool_call_salesforce_search`, `mock_tool_call_salesforce_get_contact`, `mock_tool_call_zendesk_search`, `mock_tool_call_zendesk_add_comment`, `mock_tool_call_zendesk_create_ticket` |

`identify_issue` and `end` have no business tools. The escalation is written
once, only after the caller says yes to the read-back: a comment when the caller
gave a ticket number, otherwise a new ticket with a priority of low, normal,
high, or urgent.

## Sample data

After an escalation, the agent says the support team usually follows up within
one business day; it never promises a specific person or time.

Fixed mock data (see the
[mock-tool-call README](../../shared_mcp/app/shared_mcp/mock_tool_call/README.md)
and [`fixtures.json`](../../shared_mcp/app/shared_mcp/mock_tool_call/fixtures.json)):

- Help-center articles include "Troubleshoot data sync failures", "API returns
  401 Unauthorized", and the password or MFA and GlobalProtect VPN articles.
- CRM contact Jack Rogers, `jrogers@burlington.com`, phone +13362227000, VP,
  Facilities, Burlington Textiles Corp of America. Any other email, such as
  `dana.test20261020@example.com`, finds no contact.
- Existing tickets: 1 (solved), 2 (pending), and 3 (open, API returns 401;
  Jack Rogers). New tickets get a random four-digit number.

## Run in the portal

1. Start the portal as described in [portal/README.md](../../portal/README.md).
2. In **Editor**, choose **Load from templates**.
3. Select **Example 5: Customer Support**.
4. Choose **Try it now**, then connect in AgentRuntime.

After loading, a banner says **This Agent uses mock tools**. To use your own
tools, choose **Connect my tools** and enter a public HTTPS MCP server for each
system (Salesforce, Zendesk); the Agent calls it without credentials, so point
it at sandbox data. There is nothing to start locally.

The example uses `gpt-realtime` with `azure_semantic_vad`, `profile: normal`,
and `silence_duration_ms: 400`.

## Try these turns

- "My API calls started returning 401 errors." Expect a
  `mock_tool_call_zendesk_search` call and one step from "API returns 401
  Unauthorized", naming the title, then a wait for the result.
- "Still broken, please add to ticket 3 that it started after a key rotation."
  Expect the comment read back with no tool call. After "yes", expect one
  `mock_tool_call_zendesk_add_comment` call on ticket 3.
- In a new call, "My data sync keeps failing, escalate it, high urgency."
  Expect questions for any missing name or contact, then a read-back. Say "no,
  not yet": expect nothing filed. After a later "yes", expect one
  `mock_tool_call_zendesk_create_ticket` call and a four-digit ticket number.
- "Check my account: jrogers@burlington.com." Expect the email spelled back, a
  `mock_tool_call_salesforce_search` call, and a request for your full name
  before any details. With an unknown email, expect no contact found and only
  general guidance.
- "I was charged twice, refund it." Expect no claim that a refund was processed
  and an offer to escalate.

## Boundaries

- The company, articles, contacts, and tickets are fictional and come from the
  mock server; no ticket is real.
- `store` is `false`; enable persistence deliberately if you need it.
- To use real help-center, CRM, and ticketing systems, follow
  [Connect real tools](../../docs/05_connect_real_tools.md); conversational
  confirmation is not an authorization boundary.
