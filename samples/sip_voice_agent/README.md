# SIP Voice Agent with GPT Live

This Python sample demonstrates inbound SIP calls to a native GPT Live Voice
Agent. It creates an Agent, creates or reuses a `SipInbound` project connection,
binds it, retrieves the SIP address, configures transfer targets, reads call records,
and removes the binding after testing. It enables spoken call ending and optionally
voice-requested transfer, with explicit commands for operator transfer and hangup.

The sample uses **direct model Responses delegation**: GPT Live delegates to a
Responses model deployment, not to another Foundry Agent. SIP signaling and media
are handled by the deployed SIP Proxy, Media Gateway, and Telephony service;
no local media server is required.

```text
SIP client/PBX <-- SIP + negotiated media --> SIP Proxy / Media Gateway
                                            <-- Runtime Attach --> Telephony
                                                                   <-- native Live --> GPT Live
                                                                                       --> Responses model deployment
```

The Agent definition always uses `delegation.type=responses`. There is no backend
Agent to create or version, and this sample has no managed-Agent or client-owned
delegation mode. The service handles media conversion, native Live session
readiness, and delegation to the Responses model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+, Azure CLI sign-in (`az login`), and permission to create Agents
  and manage bindings in the specified project.
- A target region/deployment with SIP ingress, GPT Live, and Live telephony enabled.
  Verify runtime availability and SIP/RTP connectivity separately from resource creation.
- The service must include Live telephone ending and Responses `transfer_call`
  execution support. Older versions can reject `system_tools` or return an
  unsupported function result. Updating the sample does not deploy that support.
- A GPT Live deployment and a Responses model deployment available to the project.
- A **same-project `SipInbound` Connection**, not `SipOutbound`, ACS, or Twilio.
  Reuse one, or create it with the `connection` command below. That command needs
  ARM connection read permission and, for creation, write permission on the project;
  these are separate from Agent/binding data-plane permissions.
- A SIP client/PBX supporting the ingress TLS and negotiated media requirements,
  with working bidirectional media routing.

### SIP Connection configuration

The `connection` command below prepares the connection through ARM. An existing
connection can also be used directly with `bind`, without ARM setup permissions.
For digest authentication, the connection properties are:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "category": "SipInbound",
    "target": "sip",
    "authType": "CustomKeys",
    "metadata": { "sip_auth_type": "digest" },
    "credentials": {
      "keys": { "username": "<sip-username>", "password": "<sip-password>" }
    }
  }
}
```

For an IP-ACL connection use `metadata.sip_auth_type=ip_acl` and
`credentials.keys.source_cidrs` containing your actual signaling egress CIDRs.
An empty allowlist permits all source IPs; use specific egress CIDRs for testing.
Store credentials and source CIDRs in the Connection, not in the Agent definition
or public binding request. The optional binding field `allowed_calling_numbers`
filters caller identity; it does not replace SIP authentication.

The [connection preparation steps](#3-prepare-the-sip-connection) below describe
creation and verification. The [binding steps](#4-bind-and-obtain-the-sip-uri)
show how to obtain the service-generated SIP address.

## 1. Prepare

From the repository root, enter `samples/sip_voice_agent`:

```powershell
Set-Location samples/sip_voice_agent
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
az login
```

Edit `.env` with your project endpoint, **deployment names**, and connection name.
Use `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>` on HTTPS
port 443. The sample validates this Azure public-cloud Foundry host before
acquiring credentials or sending a token. Custom hosts, local endpoints, and
other cloud domains are not supported; HTTP redirects are disabled.
On Linux/macOS use `.venv/bin/python` and `cp .env.example .env`.
Use a new Agent name for this sample. No existing Agent definition or model deployment is updated.

## 2. Preview and create the Agent

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py create --agent-name sip-live-demo --dry-run
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py create --agent-name sip-live-demo
```

The frontend handles natural speech, greetings, and interruptions; substantive
questions go to the Responses model. `GPT_LIVE_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT` selects the
frontend deployment. `RESPONSES_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT` (or `--responses-model`) selects
the backend model deployment directly, not an Agent name. The definition contains:

```json
{
  "delegation": {
    "type": "responses",
    "responses": {
      "model": "<responses-deployment>",
      "instructions": "Help a telephone assistant answer the caller's question. Return a concise, speech-friendly answer."
    }
  }
}
```

The sample uses `store=false` and declares
`"system_tools": [{"name": "end_conversation"}]`. The service owns the ending
workflow; do not replace this with an ordinary backend function of the same name.
To enable voice-requested transfer, create the Agent with the configured target names:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py create --agent-name sip-live-demo --transfer-target human_support --dry-run
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py create --agent-name sip-live-demo --transfer-target human_support
```

Use this **instead of** the earlier create command for the same Agent name.
The function is declared in `delegation.responses.tools` as
`transfer_call(target, reason)`, with target restricted to the supplied names.
Concrete numbers stay in Telephony configuration. Configuring targets alone does
not add a tool to an existing Agent. Recording, SMS, and DTMF remain outside this sample.

The dry-run command can also run with just Python and explicit model arguments,
without Azure credentials, dependencies, or network access:

```powershell
python sip_voice_agent.py create --agent-name sip-live-demo --live-model gpt-live-1 --responses-model my-responses-deployment --dry-run
```

## 3. Prepare the SIP Connection

Skip this step if you already have a same-project `SipInbound` Connection and
know its name. Otherwise, use a dedicated connection name in `SIP_CONNECTION_NAME`.
The setup command is separate from `bind`: it does not create an Agent, a binding,
or a phone call, and does not change the account or project.

### Identify the project

Set `PROJECT_RESOURCE_ID` in `.env` to the **project** ARM resource ID:

```text
/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<group>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>
```

This is not `PROJECT_ENDPOINT`, an account-level ID, or an Agent ID. Obtain it
from the Azure portal resource view, or use Azure CLI with your resource names:

```powershell
$accountId = az cognitiveservices account show --subscription '<subscription-id>' --resource-group '<group>' --name '<account-arm-name>' --query id -o tsv
$projectId = "$accountId/projects/<project-arm-name>"
az rest --method get --url "https://management.azure.com${projectId}?api-version=2025-06-01" --query '{id:id,endpoints:properties.endpoints}' -o json
```

Check that this is the same project as `PROJECT_ENDPOINT`, then copy its `id`
to `PROJECT_RESOURCE_ID`. An account's ARM name need not equal its endpoint's
custom subdomain; do not derive the ARM ID from the endpoint hostname.
The setup command uses `https://management.azure.com` and an ARM-scoped token;
Agent and binding commands continue to use the Foundry endpoint and token.

### Choose authentication and run setup

For **digest**, fill `SIP_USERNAME` and `SIP_PASSWORD` in your local, git-ignored
`.env` using a dedicated username and a strong password. Use the same values in
the SIP client/PBX credential store. Do not put credentials in command-line
arguments or commit them. Leave `SIP_AUTH_TYPE` unset for the default digest mode,
or explicitly set `SIP_AUTH_TYPE=digest`.
Environment-variable interpolation is disabled when reading `.env`, so `${...}`
inside a password is preserved rather than expanded.

For **IP ACL**, set `SIP_AUTH_TYPE=ip_acl` and `SIP_SOURCE_CIDRS` to a non-empty,
comma-separated list of your actual public SIP signaling egress IPs/CIDRs. Digest
credentials are not used in this mode. For example, the **documentation-only**
value `203.0.113.10/32,2001:db8::1/128` must be replaced with real egress addresses.
Unlike the service's allow-all empty value, this sample requires an explicit,
non-empty list when creating an IP ACL connection.

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py connection --dry-run
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py connection
```

Use `--project-resource-id`, `--connection`, or `--auth-type` to override those
non-secret settings. `--dry-run` prints the conditional GET/PUT plan with credential
placeholders; it performs no authentication or network calls and prints no secrets.

The command first GETs the named project connection. If it exists, the command
checks `SipInbound`, `CustomKeys`, and the authentication mode, then reports
`status: existing` without a PUT or reading credential values from the environment.
If `SIP_AUTH_TYPE` / `--auth-type` is explicitly set, it must match the existing mode.
Only a **404** triggers creation using your supplied configuration, followed by a
GET to verify the result before reporting `status: created`. Missing credentials,
wrong connection types, authorization failures, and other HTTP errors stop setup.
The output contains the name, resource ID, status, and authentication mode, never
the credential payload or raw server response.

Run only one setup process for a new connection name. ARM's PUT is create-or-update,
so the initial GET is not an atomic create-only guarantee against another writer.
Use a unique dedicated name; do not use this sample for concurrent provisioning
or credential rotation. No operation is automatically retried or rolled back.
If creation times out or is only accepted asynchronously, inspect ARM before
retrying or binding; it may already have created the connection.

You can verify the connection's non-secret configuration independently:

```powershell
$connectionName = 'sip-inbound-sample' # Use your SIP_CONNECTION_NAME.
az rest --method get --url "https://management.azure.com${projectId}/connections/${connectionName}?api-version=2025-06-01" --query '{id:id,category:properties.category,authType:properties.authType,metadata:properties.metadata}' -o json
```

Keep `SIP_CONNECTION_NAME` set to that name for the next step. Creating the
Connection alone does not establish SIP routing or prove a working call.

## 4. Bind and obtain the SIP URI

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py bind --agent-name sip-live-demo --dry-run
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py bind --agent-name sip-live-demo
```

The binding request is:

```json
{ "provider": "sip", "connection_name": "sip-inbound-sample" }
```

Optionally repeat `--allowed-caller +14255550100` for the actual caller identities
you intend to permit. Omission imposes no caller-number filter; Connection authentication still applies.

Save the returned **`binding.id`** and **`binding.incoming_call_url`**. The latter
is a SIP URI, not an HTTPS webhook. Use it unchanged, including its routing user,
host, port, region, and `transport=tls`.

Read it again at any time:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py show --agent-name sip-live-demo
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py show --agent-name sip-live-demo --binding-id '<returned-id>'
```

`show` without an ID prints the first page, including any pagination metadata.
`bind` creates a new binding and is not idempotent. If it times out, run `show`
before retrying; the service may already have created the binding. For Agent
creation, inspect the named Agent before retrying. Create operations are not
retried or rolled back automatically.

## 5. Configure transfer destinations

Copy `transfer_targets.example.json` to `transfer_targets.local.json` and replace
the example number with a real, authorized E.164 destination, such as a Genesys
queue's externally reachable number. Use the same `name` passed to
`create --transfer-target`. The current SIP provider accepts
`destination: {"type": "phone_number", "value": "+..."}`; a Genesys queue ID,
extension, or SIP URI is not an interchangeable destination.

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py targets --agent-name sip-live-demo
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py targets --agent-name sip-live-demo --file transfer_targets.local.json --dry-run
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py targets --agent-name sip-live-demo --file transfer_targets.local.json --yes
```

This replaces the **complete agent-scoped target list**, shared by its bindings.
The command GETs the current ETag and sends `If-Match` on PUT; it stops on a
missing ETag or conflict. An empty array clears all targets. Inspect the result
after a timeout before deciding whether to retry.

## 6. Call and verify both directions

In your SIP client or PBX route:

1. Use the exact `incoming_call_url` as the destination and TLS for SIP signaling.
2. For digest, set the authentication username/password from the Connection in
   the client's credential store, not in this script or shell history. Let the
   client answer the SIP challenge. For IP ACL, use the allowlisted signaling
   egress address. Follow the ingress's client/trunk registration requirements;
   the generated URI itself is a call destination, not a registration account.
3. Configure media encryption and codecs to match the target gateway. Ensure SDP
   advertises a media address reachable by the peer and the negotiated ports are
   reachable in both directions; successful SIP/TLS alone does not prove media works.
4. Speak first (for example, "Hello, explain what SIP does in one sentence").
   Check that the agent understands the request, responds audibly, handles a
   follow-up, and stops speaking when interrupted.
5. On separate calls, ask to speak to `human_support`, then test an explicit
   goodbye. Confirm that transfer reaches the intended party and the farewell
   plays before hangup. Also test a busy/rejected destination and verify the
   original conversation can continue. A submitted transfer is not proof of answer.

The Agent's **24 kHz PCM is the internal MG-to-Live media format**, not a forced
SIP codec. The SIP offer/answer determines the external codec. If SDP selects
PCMU/8000, changing the Agent's sample rate will not upgrade that leg; inspect
both peers' supported codecs and the selected SDP. Wideband audio requires a
compatible codec negotiated by both peers.

Inspect the call record:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py calls --agent-name sip-live-demo
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py calls --agent-name sip-live-demo --call-id '<returned-call-id>'
```

The list prints up to 20 recent SIP records; the individual read includes the
service's available diagnostics. Treat records as private operational data.
A SIP `200 OK`, an existing binding, or received RTP packets alone is not a passing
conversation test: verify meaningful caller speech and an audible, relevant reply.
For `bridge_failed`, correlate the call ID and time with Media Gateway Runtime
Attach and Agents/model logs. Check deployment, authentication, runtime attach,
NAT, and firewall configuration before changing codec settings.

### Operator call controls

Use the service-generated `call.id` from `calls`, not the SIP `Call-ID` header:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py transfer --agent-name sip-live-demo --call-id '<call-id>' --target human_support --dry-run
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py transfer --agent-name sip-live-demo --call-id '<call-id>' --target human_support
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py end --agent-name sip-live-demo --call-id '<call-id>' --dry-run
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py end --agent-name sip-live-demo --call-id '<call-id>'
```

These commands POST once to `.../telephony/calls/{id}:transfer` with
`{"target":"human_support"}` or `.../{id}:end` without a body. They require
Agent write permission and an active call. They do not synthesize an announcement
or farewell. Check the call record and actual call outcome; do not blindly repeat
a timed-out action. Hold/resume and summary delivery are not implemented here.

For Genesys Cloud trunk, routing, authentication, and transfer settings, see
[Genesys SIP integration](GENESYS.md).

## 7. Remove test routing

Hang up first. Delete only the binding you created:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python sip_voice_agent.py unbind --agent-name sip-live-demo --binding-id '<returned-id>' --yes
```

This reads the current ETag and sends it as `If-Match`; a missing ETag or a
concurrent-update `412` stops cleanup rather than using `*` or blind retries.
Deleting a binding removes routing for new calls; it is not a hangup operation.
The Agent, model deployments, and Connection remain intact, including a Connection
created by the `connection` command. Remove the dedicated test Agent
through Agent management when no longer needed. Retain shared model deployments
and Connections used by other applications.

## Offline validation

After installing the requirements in step 1, run from the sample directory:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Tests use the real dotenv parser and mock HTTP responses and credentials without
calling live services.
They cover direct model Responses delegation, required deployment configuration,
connection reuse and creation, digest/IP ACL validation, ARM token isolation, secret-free output, exact binding
fields, transfer declarations, target replacement, call-control requests,
URL escaping, ETag cleanup, and failure propagation.
They do **not** validate real SIP/TLS/RTP, model behavior, audio quality, or deployed
feature gates. Those require the manual two-way call above.
