# Finance with Handoff - Realtime

## Overview

This sample owns the Realtime Finance template: an outbound personal-loan call
that verifies the customer, negotiates an indicative offer, discloses charges,
captures credit-bureau consent and books a loan-officer appointment. Its root
[`agent.json`](agent.json) uses `gpt-realtime`, `whisper-1` transcription and `en-IN-Diya:DragonHDLatestNeural`, with 400 ms Semantic VAD.

The [Cascade sample](../example1_finance_with_handoff_cascade/README.md)
has its own directory and version history. Portal template IDs and Agent names
remain `finance-example-realtime` and `finance-example-cascade-luna`.

## Call flow

The greeting identifies Virtual Finance and the generic purpose. When the
customer first speaks, the call enters identity verification directly; there
is no dial assessment, IVR navigation or voicemail stage.

```text
rpc -> offer -> offer_decision -> charges_consent -> appointment -> offer_summary -> end
         \________________ wrap_up (decline, failed check, end request) _________/
```

| Stage | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `rpc` | Silently calls `start_call`, asks "Am I speaking with <first name>?", then the date of birth, and calls `confirm_right_party`. |
| `offer` | Prices and negotiates with `calculate_indicative_loan_offer`; only an explicit "I accept" or "I decline" after the final readback is a decision. |
| `offer_decision` | Records the exact words with `record_customer_offer_decision`. |
| `charges_consent` | Calls `present_charges`, then speaks the charge disclosure and the credit-bureau consent question as one message, and records the answer with `capture_bureau_consent`. |
| `appointment` | Books phone or onsite with `schedule_callback` and records `qualified_lead`, silently. |
| `offer_summary` | Recaps the offer and appointment from `prepare_offer_summary`. |
| `wrap_up` | Records the non-qualified outcome with `set_disposition`. |
| `end` | Calls `end_conversation` only. |

The greeting thanks the customer; when they first reply, the transfer into
`rpc` explains the purpose and the identity check. After the recap the agent
asks whether anything else is needed. Every edge into `end` speaks the fixed
closing "Thank you for your time. Goodbye.", so the customer always hears it
before the call ends. The charge
disclosure shares the consent question's message because the Realtime model
dropped it when it had to speak and hand off in the same response.

Realtime and Cascade share the same graph, greeting and shared prompt; when the
two runtimes favoured different spoken styles, the Realtime choice was kept.
Cascade waits for an LLM call on every tool and handoff, so it alone adds
latency cover: a short spoken lead-in before confirming the date of birth,
recording consent and booking; rotating static interim responses on offer
pricing; and transfer messages into charges, the appointment and the recap.
This cut silent waiting in text-driven accept-and-book calls from about 53 s
to 37 s per call. Realtime answers quickly enough without it.

## Conversation style

The shared prompt asks the agent to respond first to what the customer just
said, especially a worry, correction, hesitation or frustration, in one short
specific clause, then take one next step. "I understand" or an apology alone
does not count, and the agent must not invent feelings or praise. The opening
thanks the customer, explains the identity check, and asks for the date of
birth "to keep your account secure". Tool amounts are sent as plain integers
of rupees.

## Try these turns

- When asked whether you are Mengyou, say "Yes, this is Mengyou."
- When asked for your date of birth, say "1 January".

## Configure and run

Follow the [setup guide](../../docs/01_setup_subscription.md) and
[MCP configuration guide](../../docs/02_mcp_settings.md), then:

```bash
cd samples/example1_finance_with_handoff_realtime
cp .env.example .env
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your Foundry Project endpoint in `.env`. The CLI reads the same generated
`../../shared_mcp/config/generated/example1.local.env` as Cascade, targeting
`/mcp/finance-handoff`. Credentials stay in the Project connection, not the
portable Agent definition. Existing ignored `.env` and `.venv` files under the
former sample directory are not moved or deleted; configure the new directory
explicitly rather than copying secrets into a backup.

```bash
.venv/bin/python sample.py publish
.venv/bin/python sample.py check
.venv/bin/python sample.py connect
.venv/bin/python sample.py run \
  --message "Hello, who is calling?" --expect-handoff --expect-mcp
```

Publication uses the SDK raw-body overload and verifies handoff/MCP readback.
The CLI validates text turns over the real Voice WebSocket; it does not play
audio or establish VAD/audio quality. Publication and runtime calls may incur
charges. See the [run guide](../../docs/03_run_samples.md).

## Template versions

In Portal **Load from templates**, choose **Example 1: Finance with Handoff -
Realtime**. The root [`agent.json`](agent.json) is its only version. Earlier versions were removed on 2026-10-21 and remain in Git history.

## Validation

Business rework: 12 of 12 text-driven Voice WebSocket conversations passed
deterministic checks (accept-and-book and a decline flow with a worry, a
correction and frustration, three times per runtime): `start_call` first,
charges spoken, tools in business order, closing spoken and
`end_conversation` completed. The current defaults passed the same checks.

Fluency used the existing Luna judge (`fluency-first`) on the worry,
correction and frustration turns, three repeats each:

| Version | Realtime pass, score | Cascade pass, score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Business rework, before fluency changes | 5/9, 3.78 | 7/9, 4.81 |
| Default | 6/9, 4.69 | 7/9, 4.89 |

Most remaining judge failures add a period question after answering a rate
question. Text turns do not establish audio quality, latency under real
speech recognition, or VAD behaviour.
