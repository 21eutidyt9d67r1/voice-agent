Voice Agent is now available in **public preview**, making voice a first-class modality in Foundry Agent Service. We've received great feedback from customers and are working with them to move their voice agents into production as we prepare for general availability (GA).

# Voice Agent and Voice Live

[Voice Live](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live) is the foundation for real-time voice interaction, and Voice Agent builds on that foundation to deliver complete voice-first agents. Voice Live handles the real-time voice experience, while Voice Agent adds the intelligence, tools, knowledge, and orchestration required to build end-to-end agentic applications.

![Architecture comparison: Voice Live with a direct LLM versus a managed Voice Agent in Foundry, retaining the voice pipeline and tool-call flow while adding agent management capabilities.](assets/voice-live-to-voice-agent.png)

**We recommend that customers using Voice Live with a direct LLM migrate to Voice Agent.** Voice Agent builds on Voice Live capabilities rather than replacing them: keep your real-time voice experience, speech recognition and synthesis, turn-taking, interruptions, and local function calls, while gaining a managed, named agent in Foundry.

Migration is about gaining agent capabilities, not giving up Voice Live features. Voice Agent adds reusable, versioned configuration, built-in orchestration, Foundry tools and connectors, knowledge integration, conversation state management, observability, evaluation, and agent lifecycle management. Check model, voice, region, and access availability for your target Foundry Project before migrating; feature availability and configuration depend on the selected pipeline.

Start with the [Voice Live to Voice Agent migration sample](samples/voice_live_to_voice_agent/README.md), which preserves the same speech pipeline, settings, and client-executed local function handler before and after migration.

For new voice-first applications, start with Voice Agent. Direct Voice Live remains an option when you deliberately need to manage your own agent stack and low-level orchestration.

## Voice Agent Quality And Scalability

### Latency

Speech-to-speech models can achieve latency as low as **500 ms** on service side. Cascaded pipelines (**STT → LLM → TTS**) can also deliver low latency < 1s with the right LLM and streaming speech configuration. Actual latency depends on the model, region, network conditions, and tool calls.

### Speech and model quality

Voice Agent brings together advanced speech and language models, including [GPT Realtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live-how-to), [GPT Live](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/concepts/gpt-live), Azure speech-to-text and [HD voices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=text-to-speech), and MAI Transcribe and MAI Voice. Choose the combination that best fits your languages, domain, and conversational experience.  For more resources and samples for Azure Speech HD / MAI voices, visit the [Azure Text-to-Speech repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Speech-TTS).

## Voice Agent Extended Samples

### Start here

This directory is the entry point for the Voice Agent portal, runnable samples,
the Finance reference workflow, and its shared MCP service. Detailed setup and
operation instructions live with the component that owns them; this file routes
users and coding agents to the correct entry point.

See [Platform support](#platform-support) for workflow-specific operating-system
requirements.

For an unqualified request such as **"run the UI"** or **"start the portal"**,
use [`portal/`](portal/README.md). It is the general Voice Agent UI and runs on
`http://127.0.0.1:9527` by default. Do not start the Finance MCP stack unless
the request mentions Finance, Templates, or the shared MCP.

### Portal + local MCP quickstart

Use this path when the portal must publish or run the checked-in Templates.
It is the recommended end-to-end workflow:

```bash
cd /path/to/voice-agent
az login
./scripts/setup-local-examples.sh \
   --project-endpoint "https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
./scripts/login-devtunnel.sh
./scripts/setup-local-examples.sh --check
./scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh restart
```

`login-devtunnel.sh` uses GitHub device-code authentication. Follow the printed
`https://github.com/login/device` prompt. Azure operations continue to use the
separate identity selected by `az login`.

Success requires `local_mcp_and_portal=ready`. Open
**http://localhost:18098**, then verify with:

```bash
./scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh status
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18003/healthz
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18098/healthz
```

Port `9527` is only for a portal-only session without the managed local MCP
lifecycle. Do not run a second manual portal after this quickstart.

### Choose an entry point

### Instructions for coding agents

When the user asks to run or debug something from this directory:

1. Verify the environment follows [Platform support](#platform-support) for the
   selected workflow before running commands.
2. Select the component from the table above and read its `README.md` before
   running commands.
3. Treat **UI** without a qualifier as the general [`portal/`](portal/README.md).
4. Treat **Finance UI**, **portal Templates with Finance**, or
   **shared MCP UI** as the workflow documented in
   [`docs/03_run_samples.md`](docs/03_run_samples.md).
5. Reuse an existing component-local `.env` and virtual environment when they
   are valid. Never copy credentials or endpoints between unrelated `.env`
   files without the user's intent.
6. Start servers as long-running processes, verify their `/healthz` endpoint,
   and report the browser URL and log location. Do not report success merely
   because a process was spawned.
7. Do not silently fall back to mock data or a different Azure Project when
   authentication, endpoint, model, or preview checks fail.

For the default portal route, follow [`portal/README.md`](portal/README.md) to
prepare `portal/.env` and its `.venv`, start `portal/demo_server.py`, then
verify:

```text
GET http://127.0.0.1:9527/healthz
```

For the complete Finance route, follow the ordered
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) workflow. The normal lifecycle commands are:

```bash
./scripts/setup-local-examples.sh --project-endpoint "https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
./scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh restart
./scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh status
./scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh stop
```

The setup command installs Node.js 22 and the Dev Tunnel CLI under the ignored
`.local-mcp-and-ui/tools/` directory when they are missing. It also supports
minimal Linux Python installations that provide `venv` but omit `ensurepip`:
each component environment receives its own bootstrapped `pip`. No `sudo` or
system package change is required for those three tools. Azure CLI must already
be installed and authenticated; Dev Tunnel device-code authentication remains
an explicit user action because setup must not authenticate as an identity the
user did not choose.

### Platform support

**On Windows, WSL2 is required for the combined portal + local MCP automation:**

- `scripts/setup-local-examples.sh`: installs Linux tools and prepares the stack.
- `scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh`: starts, stops, and monitors Linux processes.

Run this workflow from a checkout in the WSL Linux filesystem, such as `~/src/`,
not `/mnt/c/`, and authenticate Azure CLI inside WSL.

**Other standalone Python and .NET samples can run natively on Windows.**
Follow each sample's prerequisites and commands. Bash-only wrappers still need
Bash/Unix tooling or equivalent PowerShell commands.

### Directory map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`portal/`](portal/) | General local Voice Agent portal and WebRTC UI |
| [`samples/`](samples/) | Python, .NET, and Finance samples |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | Finance architecture, setup, operation, and debugging guides |
| [`shared_mcp/`](shared_mcp/) | Shared Finance MCP source, native runtime, optional container, IaC, and deployment scripts |

### Security and environment boundaries

- Configure only Azure resources and identities the customer is authorized to
  use.
- Never place access tokens, API keys, connection secrets, or customer data in
  source files.
- Use Foundry Project connections or environment-based credentials.
- The portal and samples use Azure Foundry; running the local portal does not run
  the Azure voice service locally.
- Review each component's persistence and recording behavior before using
  sensitive prompts, audio, transcripts, or tool output.
